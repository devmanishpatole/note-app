My learning Node.js Journey.
- Importing Node.js core modules.
- Importing my own files.
- Importing npm modules.

## Things I have touched in Node.js

**Node.js in-built modules:**
- [File System](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) - The `fs` module enables interacting with the file system.

**npm modules:**
- [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) - A library of string validators and sanitizers.
- [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) - Terminal string styling done right.
- [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) - Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments.
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. (this module is installed globally)
